Because [Cohost is shutting down](https://cohost.org/staff/post/7611443-cohost-to-shut-down), I decided to rebuild my whole website so I could use it as a blog. I already have an [ActivityPub server](https://social.ashwalker.net/Ash), but the software running it ([Akkoma](https://akkoma.dev/AkkomaGang/akkoma/)) doesn't really work well for long-form posting.

The old version of my website <img style="float: inline-end" src="ashwalker.net_old.png" alt="A screenshot of the old version of this website."/> was built entirely manually, which involved a lot of copy-paste.
