Added a [JSON feed](/feed.json), and some extra data to the [Atom feed](/feed.xml).

If you don't already have a feed reader, I like [Fluent Reader](https://github.com/yang991178/fluent-reader) and [RSS Guard](https://github.com/martinrotter/rssguard) on desktop, and [Fluent Reader Lite](https://github.com/yang991178/fluent-reader-lite) and [Read You](https://github.com/Ashinch/ReadYou) on mobile.

If you're using Firefox (which you should be), you can use [Feed Preview](https://code.guido-berhoerster.org/addons/firefox-addons/feed-preview/) to show an icon in the address bar when a site has a feed.
