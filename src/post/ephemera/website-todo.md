To do list for this website:
- Add a section for links to websites that I like
- Add a section for 88x31 badges
- Make an 88x31 badge for myself
- Write an article about blocking AI scrapers in Nginx
  - Figure out how to block scrapers on Neocities, if that's possible?
- Make a dark theme
- More robust date handling on posts (because of the way I'm building it in Nix, I can't just use file creation date)
