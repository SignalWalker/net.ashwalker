fixed the "now listening" widget on the right sidebar (when you're on a big enough screen), so that should work now yaaaay

(the code for that is [here](https://git.ashwalker.net/Ash/ashwalker.net/src/commit/28ea0630a6e868f069b190501fa3a7bcb6624b51/src/_includes/components/widget-listening/main.js) if you wanna look at that)
