Added some buttons to the bottom of each page, since it was free real estate and I want to link to other sites that I like.

::: note
If you want to put buttons on your own site, you should probably set [`image-rendering: pixelated`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image-rendering) in their CSS (or the CSS of an ancestor element), because most 88x31 buttons are pixel art and the default upscaler browsers use for images tends to make pixel art look bad.

I'll probably make a dedicated page for links to other sites at some point? I might do that immediately after posting this; who knows.

Maybe next I'll write a guide to CSS grids? Since, you know, that seems like something people might want.

Also, does this note block thing look good? The one floating to the side of this post. (Or, maybe not floating to the side, if you're reading this in a future where I changed how notes look.) <small>Maybe I should also add a comments section, somehow.</small>

I'm also considering including some Javascript to randomize the order of buttons when you load the page, just so there's no bias towards any specific site. Maybe I'm overthinking it? Hm.
