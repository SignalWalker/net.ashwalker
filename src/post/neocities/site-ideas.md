future site improvement ideas:
- widget for embedding posts from other sites
  - [h-entry](https://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry)
  - fediverse posts (i.e. mastodon, akkoma, etc.)
  - tumblr (unfortunately i do still use tumblr...)
- widget that shows recent posts from [my fediverse account](https://social.ashwalker.net/Ash)
- day/night + weather cycle
  - this was a joke but actually i could do this by swapping out the background image depending on time of day and the weather...
- changelog section on the homepage, generated from git commit logs
