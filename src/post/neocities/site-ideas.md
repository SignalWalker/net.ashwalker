future site improvement ideas:
- widget for embedding posts from other sites
  - [h-entry](https://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry)
  - fediverse posts (i.e. mastodon, akkoma, etc.)
  - tumblr (unfortunately i do still use tumblr...)
- widget that shows recent posts from [my fediverse account](https://social.ashwalker.net/Ash)
- day/night + weather cycle
  - this was a joke but actually i could do this by swapping out the background image depending on time of day and the weather...
- changelog section on the homepage, generated from git commit logs
- word count on fiction posts

edit: i've been wanting to replace eleventy with a handcrafted server that generates stuff dynamically so i can, for example, post from my phone instead of having to open neovim and commit posts into git, and i just realized i don't have to write the whole thing from scratch and can instead just start with the part that generates posts, and have eleventy generate everything else until i've written the rest of it
