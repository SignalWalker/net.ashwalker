![A screenshot of my desktop. The wallpaper renderer has tried to render two images at once, resulting in a picture of a girl sitting in bed looking out of her apartment window over a city at night, overlayed with a pixel art waterfall cascading over a bridge, which appears to run over the city.
The bottom right corner of the screen has a widget displaying the album art for Nervous Young Man by Car Seat Headrest.](/post/neocities/swww-error.png)
