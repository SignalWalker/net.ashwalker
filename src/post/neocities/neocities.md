I've been updating [my website](https://ashwalker.net/), which has been... somewhat? mirrored? to Neocities for a while, so now I'm updating the Neocities version, and I'm adding \~*Neocities exclusive content*\~ (i.e. this post, so far).

Not sure how much I want the Neocities version to be different from the main version. I'm planning on posting fiction that I'm written here and I'm a little too embarrassed about that to have it just right up there on the front page of the main site (since that's also gonna be what, like, employers and recruiters and stuff see), but I haven't decided yet whether I want that to be Neocities-*exclusive* or just displayed more prominently on Neocities than on the main site.

Probably the latter? Kinda depends on how hard it is to wrangle [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) (the site generator I'm using) into doing it that way.

The [RSS feed](/feed.xml) actually is different for the Neocities version, since the Neocities version has exclusive posts.

Anyway, since this is Neocities (or maybe you're reading this directly from the [Git repo](https://git.ashwalker.net/Ash/ashwalker.net/), for some reason), here's a \~CSS Secret\~: all the CSS on this site is based on the CSS I wrote for an instant messenger I'm working on called Troposphere, and there's still some leftover artifacts from that -- for example, most of the variables are called things like `--channel-shadow` or `--msg-bg`, and there are still some rules defined for classes that don't actually appear in the HTML, because I haven't cleaned those out yet.

Feel free to steal the CSS, by the way, as long as you link back here.
