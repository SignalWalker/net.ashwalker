A couple friends of mine are working on a game called [Brickadia](https://brickadia.com/), which is a multiplayer sandbox game where you build things out of blocks. There's a tool called [obj2brs](https://github.com/kmschr/obj2brs) that, as the name implies, converts `.obj` files to Brickadia save files, which lets you import things like Windfall Island from Wind Waker into the game.
